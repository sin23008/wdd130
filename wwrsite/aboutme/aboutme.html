    <p>My name is Ryan Sinclair, and I am a CIT major. In the near future, that degree will be dissolved into two individual degrees, one of which will be the Cyber Security degree which I will be switching into.</p>
    <p>As for things that I like to do, I love playing a bunch of different sports. My main sport is baseball, but I also love playing ultimate frisbee, spikeball, racquetball, frisbee golf, and a few others. I also enjoy playing a few different instruments, some of which being the trumpet, trombone, tuba, saxophone, and guitar (both acoustic and electric).</p>
